The code is this directory was copied from /usr/src/sys/arch/i386/boot
in the NetBSD 0.9 release. The files asm.S and boot.c have been modified
to boot the Mach micro kernel. The diffs are in the file DIFFS.

The boot program builds under a NetBSD system using the standard
make. The "boot" file can be dd'ed on to a floppy and used from there.
When it prompts for a file you can specify [hs]d(0,0)netbsd or mach which
ever you wish to boot. 

The disklabel program needs to be used to install it on the hard disk.
This program wants the two files "biosboot" and "bootbios".  See the man
page for disklabel for its usage.

The default file to be booted is "netbsd". The name "mach" must be
used for a Mach kernel.

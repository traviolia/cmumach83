The mach kernel can be built either with the OSF/CMU ODE build tools
or with a plain DeBoor make program. The first method can be used to
build on a variety of machines and Unix operating systems, but requires
that you get a copy of our tools, (odemake, gcc.2.3.3, et. al.) from
the buildtools directory. This method is documented in the mach3_build
document in this directory.

The second method only works on NetBSD, FreeBSD, BSDi and such systems.
It has been tested with NetBSD 0.9 and gcc,2.4.5. It is described
in the flat/README.2nd file.

This distribution also contains the sources for two boot programs. The standard
Mach one is in kernel/<machine>/boot and will normally boot a Mach 2.5
integrated kernel and the Mach 3.0 micro-kernel.  There is also a slight
modification of the netbsd boot program that will boot either the standard
netbsd kernel or the Mach 3.0 micro kernel. These sources are in the directory
boot.netbsd.

Instructions for installing the kernel and the server that it calls can
be found in the mach3_setup document. The current choices for a OS server
are POE, UX or LITES. POE and LITES can be FTP'ed from the CMU Mach src
area. The UX server is based on licensed BSD4.3 code and may only be SUP'ed
by sites who have Mach licenses.
